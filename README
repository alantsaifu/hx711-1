1. load cell reading
3. sysfs 
.../hx711/power: 0 | 1
.../hx711/gram
.../hx711/calib - write the correct value to the current weight load
.../hx711/raw

* calibration
	- calibration data is sent to the module from userspace
	- write 5 pairs of "raw gram" records to calib entry
	- all read from sysfs return 'error' when waiting for calibration data
	- steps
		1. write dummy calibration data to make the device enter working mode
		2. put 50g, 100g, 150g, 200g on the weight and read the raw, respectively
		3. write the raw with corresponding weight in gram to calib entry
